This whole thing is fucked. Let's redo some stuff


There should be some datatypes header that stores all the common datatypes
There should be one main data variable that holds all the current data, which is passed by reference to each driver object

Data object:
    - BNO data
        - Orientation (euler angles)
        - angular velocity
        - linear acceleration
        - acceleration
        - gravity
    - Ball data (touch screen)
        - Current location
        - Speed Estimate
        - Maybe acceleration estimate?
        - Slip estimate?
    - Servo Feedback
    - Ball State Targets
        - Target Position
        - Target Velocity
    - Servo Data
        - Current desired positions
        - Current actual position
    - 
    

Each component gets its own driver:
    1. SSC32
    2. touch screen
    3. IMU
    4. robot kinematics
    5. controller



Notes on virtual axes vs physical axes
Performed a +25mm move for the hx_x, hx_y, hx_z axes
	- hx_x = x+ (as drawn on touchpad)
	- hx_y = y+ (as drawn on touchpad)
	- hx_z = z+
Performed a 15 degree rotation for the rotations (hx_a, hx_b, hx_c)
	- hx_a = positive rotation about x
	- hx_b = positive rotation about y
	- hx_c = positive rotation about z
	
Note: observed some flexing in the rods, and some tremors in the servos. They seemed to be fighting eachother. Something is definitely not set correctly...
