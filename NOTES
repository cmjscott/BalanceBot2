This whole thing is fucked. Let's redo some stuff


There should be some datatypes header that stores all the common datatypes
There should be one main data variable that holds all the current data, which is passed by reference to each driver object

Data object:
    - BNO data
        - Orientation (euler angles)
        - angular velocity
        - linear acceleration
        - acceleration
        - gravity
    - Ball data (touch screen)
        - Current location
        - Speed Estimate
        - Maybe acceleration estimate?
        - Slip estimate?
    - Servo Feedback
    - Ball State Targets
        - Target Position
        - Target Velocity
    - Servo Data
        - Current desired positions
        - Current actual position
    - 
    

Each component gets its own driver:
    1. SSC32
    2. touch screen
    3. IMU
    4. robot kinematics
    5. controller
